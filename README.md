# Lobe-Tour-page-clone
Challenge from Frontend Practice.

Just a fun little challenge by Frontend Practice. It was fun but also a bit frustrating at times. Especially making it all responsive, but I think it turned out pretty good.

One thing that is different from my clone and the original page: The original Lobe Tour page the navbar & footer links increase their size on hover. I tried using Transform: scale() on the links but it didn't work. Maybe if I wrapped the links in a div, and used transform scale on the div, it would've worked.
